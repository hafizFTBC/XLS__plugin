#Objective
Allow users to use excel as per normal and sync their data to VAL repository or read from VAL repository to 
update the data they have in their excel. This would allow them to perform their tasks in their favourite software 
without the additional hussle of going to and fro to VAL and allow them to keep their formatting in the excel without
the need of VAL to maintain their format
